WHO AM I?
========
Hola! I am Tracy Asamoah and my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a black first-gen from Kumasi, Ghana. I completed my Bachelor's in Materials Engineering (2022) as the valedictorian from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana.  I am currently working in my department as a teaching and research assistant. I am invested in transforming the world through applied science. I aim to define new and lasting frontiers that revolutionalizes our current understanding of sustainability through energy storage and conversion.
I am working towards securing a PhD position and fellowship for the fall of 2024. I am on the look for likeminded professors and schools in terms of excellence in research, drive and persistence, analytical and scientific thinking, leadership, interdisciplinary work and social responsibility. Are you also looking for such qualities? I am undoubtedly the best choice.

Research Focus
==============
My research focuses on applying fundamental engineering insights to address grand challenges in climate and sustainability and removing barriers today's woman faces. I have come to the realization that unleashing the full potential of renewables is not an individual feat but a collative one. But with decades of this movement, carbon emissions are still pertinent in our world causing negative effects on us and our surroundings. My first breakthrough in this field was to engineer new carbon-free precursors for cupels. The synthesis route of the former precursors had about 95% carbon emitted in order to obtain CaO. At the end of the work, I obtained 99% purity of CaO. Through this research, I  was awarded the top 10% KEEP research grant as the team lead. Next, was the development of solar cookers for secondary institutions. These institutes mainly use firewood and charcoal which have pronounced carbon emissions. The work sought to harness solar energy in cooking. At the end of the day, we achieved majority of the institutions solar cooking with minimal carbon emissions and having night cooking made possible with the use of erythritol  phase change materials. This work was also under the funding of the SEESA research grant. My research journey has evolved into modelling CO2 capture and hydrogen storage in MOFs using crystal graphs and the production of green hydrogen through seawater splitting.

What's next on my journey to combat climate change and empowering today's woman? I am confident that I would attain great heights in my PhD, seeking to establish new and lasting frontiers.

Research Interests
==================
My research interests spans across the breadth and width of environment and sustainability for green futures which complies with SDG 7 & 13. Subfields include but not limited to: 
Battery R&D including Li, Na, Zn-ion batteries, electrolytes and solid-state batteries
Catalysis including photocatalysis and electrocatalysis
